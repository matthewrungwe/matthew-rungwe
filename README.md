# Matthew Rungwe | My portfolio website

The website is simply a portfolio to show the level of my experience, education and skills. The website also has sections for the projects that I have worked on and my blog.

## Motivation

I believe every developer out there needs to have a digital resume to showcase what they can do. My portfolio website is also my way to showcase who I am and what I can do.
